# Typography Elements

There's quite a few classes that will help you with typography, so let's take a look at what's available.

# Blockquotes

`blockquote` `blockquote-footer` `figure`

Bootstrap has a special blockquote class that makes the font a little bigger. There's a special footer version of the class, but if you want to use it, you should use a figure container since it should be outside the blockquote according to conventions.

# Basic Lists

## list-{TYP}

`unstyled`

`inline` `inline-item`

There's a whole set of more complex list and list group classes, but there's a couple of simple classes you can use with regular lists as well. The unstyled class simply removes the margins and bullets, while the inline class brings the list items next to each other...like navigation.
