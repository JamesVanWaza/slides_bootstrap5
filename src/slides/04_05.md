# Misc Metrics

> >

There are a few other metrics related classes that don't really fit into a particular category, so let's take a look at how that works.

# Aspect Ratios

## `ratio`

## `ratio-{VAL}`

`1x1` `4x3` `16x9` `21x9`

There are some aspect ratio classes to help with setting the proportions of elements. These are designed to go in a container class that wraps elements like `<iframe>` `<embed>` `<video>`
`<object>` but will work with other elements like `<div>` or `<img>`.

# Overflow

## `overflow-{TYP}`

`auto` `hidden` `visible` `scroll`

There are some aspect ratio classes to help with what happens when the content is larger than it's container.

`overflow-auto` - is the default and will show scrollbars

`overflow-hidden` - hides the extra content

`overflow-visible` lets the content overflow

`overflow-` displays the scrollbars by defaul

# Width

## `w-{TYP}`

`25` `50` `75` `100`<br>
`auto` `mw-100` `vw-100`

<a href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/RwKxgJw?editors=1000" target="_blank"><code class="code-royal">Try it</code></a>

Here are the classes that help you control the width of an item.

The first few let you change the widt of an item to a percentage of the width of the container.

`auto` will try to match the width of the container.

`mw-100` will try to be a maximum of 100% of the width of the container. Notice that if I make the container bigger, it will revert to 100$ width

`vw-100` tries to match the width of the viewport...most of the time, the browser window.

# Height

## `h-{TYP}`

`25` `50` `75` `100`<br>
`auto` `mh-100` `vh100`

Similarly there are ways to control the height that correspond to the most common CSS heights.

The first few will try to make an element a percentage of the height of the container...as long as the container has a height.

`mh-100` will set the maximum height of an element to 100% of the height of the container.

`vw-100` will attempt to make the element match the height of the viewport. This is usually the height of the browser window.

`auto` will try to make the element have a natural height. Notice that if I take the `vh-100` height off, then they go back to an automatic height.

Height is probably one of the most unpredictable measurements in HTML and the source of frustration. It's not Bootstrap being weird. It's CSS being weird.

Notice that if I take the vh-100, then the height of the percentages goes away.

Also, if I change the display type of the element with `h-100` then the element tries to match the height of the parent.

# Stretched Link

`stretched-link`

<a href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/GRryyLy?editors=1000" target="_blank"><code class="code-royal">Try it</code></a>

This is one my favorite bootstrap classes. It will make the entire container of an element with a link clickable, which makes it easier to write code. It's magical.

# User Select

## `user-select-{TYP}`

`auto` `all` `none`

<a href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/PoWEQLg?editors=1000" target="_blank"><code class="code-royal">Try it</code></a>

User select is a great utility class that lets you control how selection works in an element. There are three options.

`user-select-auto` is the default and lets selection work normally.
