I've always loved floating labels on top of input fields, but they're not really accessible. Bootstrap provides them with a few caveats.

# Floating Labels

`form-floating`

You need to have a placeholder on each input and the inputs must come first. The label doesn't need a form-label class. Other than that, you add a `form-floating` container.

Check out the cool animation when you fill it out.
