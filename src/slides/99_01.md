The bootstrap docs are extremely well put togethe and have a lot of examples on how to use the framework. There's actually a tab you should click [called examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/) to take a peek at sample components.

One of the cool pages is called [the Cheatsheet](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/cheatsheet/), which is a list of samples of all of the components in a convenient place with links to the documentation.

There's also a site that supports bootstrap development where you can [purchase Themes](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/) that are based on bootsrap.
